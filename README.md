# Portfolio: Vincent Balalian

Welcome to my Github! I'm Vincent, a junior data engineer based in Los Angeles. I'm passionate about learning and professional growth. My goal is to effectively utilize the tools in the modern data stack to apply data theory concepts and best practices through the various stages of ELT/ETL.

## Overview

These repositories are a collection of my data projects showcasing my skills in data cleaning, processing, visualization, orchestration, and more, using various tools and technologies such as Python, R, SQL, and more.

### Projects

#### RomanCoins

A simple data engineering project, currently limited to a working web scraper that collects information about ancient Roman coins, such as mass and diameter. Though the data may not be ideal for deep analysis, [web scraper notebook](web_scraping/web_scraper.ipynb) highlights web scraping techniques and data visualization to identify potential patterns and trends in the coin data.

#### Cyclistic_case_study

An R-based case study analyzing ride-sharing data using R's impressive suite of data processing and visualization tools to uncover insights and trends in bike-sharing service usage, in order to help the marketing team develop a new strategy to target casual riders for conversion to annual members. 

#### Cointoss

A simple cointoss game using the tkinter python module for a graphical UI, demonstrating simple object-oriented programming concepts.
